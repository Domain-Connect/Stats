The project contains a repository od Domain Connect templates.

Add a statistics feature to this repository.

Architecture:
- all output files shall be in the ./dashboard directory
- scripts shall be in ./scripts directory
- static html file with statistics site
- stats.json file, which will contain all data to be included in the graphs
- update_stats.py - a python script which can be integrated into github ci/cd to update the stats on each new commit and/or on cron schedule
- all styling shall be separate in .css file
- use responsive design, so that the stats look good both on desktop and mobile
- graph controls shall allow to zoom in on the time axis as well as download of source data tables

Use colors and CI from https://www.domainconnect.org/
Assets (logos) are in ./dashboards/assets folder

Create Claude.md file so that future edits obey to the same rules.

The following statistics shall be included:
- Last updated date
- Total Templates
- Total Service Providers
- Total Merged PRs
- Total Open PRs
- Total number of Contributors
- Avg Records/Template

- Graph Templates Growth Over Time
  - Month since the beginning of the repository on X axis
  - Cumulative Templates on the first Y axis (line)
  - Added Templates in a month on the second Y axis (bar)
  - both scales shall start at zero

- Provider Growth Over Time:
  - Month since the beginning of the repository on X axis
  - Cumulative provider on the first Y axis (line)
  - Added Provider in a month on the second Y axis (bar)
  - both scales shall start at zero

- Graph Pull Requests Activity
  - Month since the beginning of the repository on X axis
  - PRs created vs PRs merged on the Y axis (bar)

- Record Types Distribution
  - horizontal bar chart showing % of templates containing each RR type
  - count RR type grouped per template, so if a template contains 5 CNAMEs, count it as 1
  - bars show percentage with label "X% (count/total)"
  - clicking a bar opens GitHub code search for that record type
    e.g. repo:Domain-Connect/Templates path:*.json "\"type\": \"NS\""

- Feature Usage
  - row of donut charts below Record Types Distribution
  - each donut shows % of templates using a feature:
    - syncPubKeyDomain (present/non-empty)
    - syncRedirectDomain (present/non-empty)
    - warnPhishing (present and set to true)
    - hostRequired (present and set to true)
  - percentage displayed in the center of each donut

- Top Providers
  - 2 Tables: for whole history and for last month
  - Show provider logo (from the first template) to the left of the provider name
  - Use providerName from template content (not filename-derived provider ID)
  - Number of templates is a clickable link opening GitHub code search for that providerId
    e.g. https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ADomain-Connect%2FTemplates+path%3A*.json+%22providerId%22%3A+%22example.com%22&type=code

- Recent Pull Requests
  - Table with PR number, name, status, labels, open date and link to github
  - for each entry list providerId/ServiceId and logo from the template (there might be more than one in one PR)

If you are not sure on anything, or need more clarification, ask the user upfront before proceeding.
